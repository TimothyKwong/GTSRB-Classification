# GTSRB-Classification
## Description
This project creates a neural network for image classification on the [German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark](https://benchmark.ini.rub.de/gtsrb_news.html).
The neural network was created using the [Pytorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) library, and utilizes techniques such as Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) and K-fold Cross Valdiation.
